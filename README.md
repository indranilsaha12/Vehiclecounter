# Vehicle Detection and Counting Project

## Overview
This project involves the detection and counting of vehicles in a video using computer vision techniques. The implementation utilizes OpenCV for image processing and NumPy for numerical operations. The system processes each video frame to detect and count vehicles crossing a predefined line.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle detection using contour detection.
- Background subtraction to isolate moving objects (vehicles).
- Counting vehicles as they cross a specific line in the video frame.
- Visualization of detected vehicles and counting line.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-detection-counting.git
